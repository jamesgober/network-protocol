//! # Transport Layer
//! 
//! This file is part of the Network Protocol project.
//! 
//! It defines the transport layer for network communication,
//! including remote and local operations.
//! 
//! The transport layer is responsible for handling the actual data transmission
//! between nodes in a network,
//! ensuring that packets are sent and received correctly.
//! 
//! It abstracts the underlying network details,
//! allowing higher-level protocol logic to focus on message routing and processing.
//!
//! The transport layer is designed to be modular and extensible,
//! supporting various transport mechanisms such as TCP, UDP, and custom protocols.
//! 
//! ## Responsibilities
//! - Send and receive packets over the network
//! - Handle connection management
//! - Provide a unified interface for different transport protocols
