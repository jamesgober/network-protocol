# network-protocol TODO List

## Completed

### Core Functionality
- ✅ Implemented core packet structure and codec
- ✅ Built transport layers (TCP, UDS, Cluster)
- ✅ Developed message structure and serialization
- ✅ Implemented dispatcher for message handling
- ✅ Added heartbeat mechanism

### Security
- ✅ Implemented secure ECDH handshake protocol
- ✅ Fixed x25519-dalek compatibility issues
- ✅ Improved cryptographic RNG implementation
- ✅ Added nonce and timestamp verification for replay protection
- ✅ Implemented session key derivation from shared secrets
- ✅ Added memory clearing for sensitive handshake data
- ✅ Ensured forward secrecy with ephemeral keys
- ✅ Integrated secure handshake into client and daemon services

### Testing
- ✅ Created unit tests for secure handshake protocol

## In Progress

### Documentation
- 🔄 Update API documentation with security implementation details
- 🔄 Document security considerations and best practices

## Planned

### Enhancements
- ⏳ Clean up remaining minor code warnings
- ⏳ Improve error handling and logging for handshake errors
- ⏳ Add more comprehensive integration tests
- ⏳ Consider adding a key rotation mechanism for long-lived connections

### Security Hardening
- ⏳ Add optional authentication layer above secure channel
- ⏳ Implement perfect forward secrecy through regular key rotation
- ⏳ Add secure credential storage and management

### Performance
- ⏳ Optimize handshake performance for resource-constrained devices
- ⏳ Add benchmarking tools for handshake operations
- ⏳ Implement optional message compression for better network performance

### Future Directions
- ⏳ Consider TLS as alternative to custom handshake protocol
- ⏳ Explore WebRTC integration for browser support
- ⏳ Investigate support for additional cipher suites
